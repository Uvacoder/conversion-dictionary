# Conversion Dictionary

A static site for finding conversion calculators. The list is quite small now but I plan to add more conversions as I move forward in my free time. I welcome any and all contributions to add a conversion calculator you would like to see.

## Contribute

Create a Markdown file in `/conversions/` with the content similar to the other `.md` files and create a JavaScript file that contains the conversion calculator logic. I'm happy to merge any PRs that follow these guidelines.
