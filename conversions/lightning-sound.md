Maybe you live in an area where lightning strikes are common, or you'd just like to know how to calculate the distance between you (a listener) and a lightning strike. Sound travels at approximately 1,100 feet per second through air. 

Therefore, once you have a rough time interval between seeing the lightning and hearing the loud boom (when the sound reaches you), it's straightforward to calculate the distance you are from it using the interval and the speed of sound through air.

<div class="lightning-calc">
  <label for="time">Enter the time interval (in seconds):</label>
  <input type="number" id="time" placeholder="Enter a value...">
  <button type="submit" id="cls">Calculate</button>
</div>
