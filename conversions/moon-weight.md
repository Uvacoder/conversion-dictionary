On Earth, the gravity is roughly 9.807 meters per second squared (m/s^2). The Moon's gravity is 16.6% (roughly 17%) of Earth's gravity. To calculate your effective weight on the Moon the following formula should be used:

```js
effective weight = (weight / Earth gravity) * Moon gravity
```

Utilize the calculator below by inputting your weight (in lbs) on Earth to calculate your effective weight on the Moon.

<div class="moon-weight">
    <label for="weight">Enter your weight (in lbs):</label>
    <input id="weight" type="number" placeholder="Enter a value...">
    <button class="calc-moon" type="submit">Calculate</button>
</div>
